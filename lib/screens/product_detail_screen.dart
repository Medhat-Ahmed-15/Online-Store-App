    //by writing this (((listen: false))) i turned off the listner for this class that means when any changes happen in the data in the provider class all classes which have listners turned on will rebuild except for this will not rebuild as its listner is turned off and i did that because for this class the class that just shows the detail of every product will not bee affected by any changes happen to the data I mean no changes will affect the UI unlike the Products Overview Screen if a new product is added then the build method of the Products Overview Screen must be called to show this new product but this class only shows data and it bring it the provider class but will not be effected by any changes
